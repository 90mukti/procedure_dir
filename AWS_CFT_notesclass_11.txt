cloud formation templates -- infrastructure as code (IAC)

aws cloud formation Template (CFT) is a IAC tool is used to only for AWS configuration similarly AZure has it's own IAC tool is AZURE resource manager (ARM)  template uses (bicep) script.

while terraform is a cross cloud platform IAC tool used form multiple cloud providers.

user submites declarative or versioned in nature to the cloud formation template. it takes the script and converts to cloud platform understandable language and does the task. API call


user(yaml or Json scripts) ------------------> IAC tool(ARM, CFT, TERRAFORM) -------------------> AWS(API calls) (cloud platform tool)


another multi cloud IAC tool is crossPlane

versioned:- these templates can be stored in s3 bucket  or github repository and can be versioned .
declarative- what you sees is what you have means its like what the commands given for these are present in cloud platform 

when you use cli- when as devops user for short actions like checking the lists of s3 bucket or ec2 instance we should prefer CLi over cft or any IAC tools.

but to perform creation or deleteion of cloud infrastructure it is convinent and recommended to use IAC tool which is comprensible , has a track too see the script and correct it or version it or upgrade or modify it.

CFT- is used notonly for Infrastructure creation it si used for Drift Detection.

Drift Detection.

what it is ? as it can detect the change what modified by any user , and what are the differences with our original configuration.
